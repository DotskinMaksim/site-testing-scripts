# Cypress Testing Framework

Cypress is a powerful tool for automated testing of modern web applications. It is designed to write, execute, and debug tests to ensure the stability and correctness of your application.

## 📋 Description

Cypress is used for:
- End-to-End (E2E) testing
- Integration testing
- Component testing (for modern UI libraries like React and Vue)

It enables testing of user interfaces and interactions with your application through a browser.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Easy installation and setup.**
- **Fast debugging** with built-in developer tools support.
- **Automatic waiting** — Cypress automatically waits for elements to load or actions to complete (unlike Selenium).
- **Supports JavaScript and TypeScript.**
- **Simplifies test creation for web applications.**
- **Snapshots** to visualize test progress.
- **Powerful GUI** for running and viewing tests.

## 🛠 Installation

1. Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed on your system.
2. Install Cypress via `npm` or `yarn`:

```bash
# Install using npm
npm install cypress --save-dev

# Install using yarn
yarn add cypress --dev

	3.	Launch Cypress to create the default project structure:

npx cypress open

This will create a cypress/ directory in your project with folders for tests, fixtures, and support code.

📂 Folder Structure

	•	cypress/integration: Contains test files.
	•	cypress/fixtures: Stores test data files.
	•	cypress/support: Contains custom commands and configurations.
	•	cypress/plugins: Holds plugins and additional configurations.

🧪 Running Tests

	•	To open the Cypress GUI:

npx cypress open

	•	To run tests in headless mode (e.g., for CI/CD pipelines):

npx cypress run

🖋 Example Test

Create a file cypress/integration/sample_spec.js:

describe('Sample E2E Test', () => {
  it('Visits the home page', () => {
    cy.visit('https://example.com'); // Open the page
    cy.contains('Example Domain').should('be.visible'); // Verify the text
  });
});

⚙️ Configuration

The cypress.json file is used to configure Cypress settings, for example:

{
  "baseUrl": "https://example.com",
  "viewportWidth": 1280,
  "viewportHeight": 720
}
